# Optimizing-V2V-Communication-Delay-Prediction-in-CAV-Vehicles-through-SUMO-and-ns-3-Simulations
Integration of SUMO mobility and ns3 wireless simulation is used to predict V2V delay in CAV platoons. Using 802.11p data and ML models like RF and XGBoost, delays are predicted from speed, distance, and RSSI. Results show accurate delay prediction for safer and more efficient CAV networks.
